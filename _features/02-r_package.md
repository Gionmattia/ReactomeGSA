The [ReactomeGSA](https://github.com/reactome/ReactomeGSA) R package is available
on [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReactomeGSA.html). 
It directly supports data structures from, for example, *limma* and *edgeR* which makes it 
straight-forward to perform multi-omics, multi-species comparative pathway analyses. Additionally,
it has dedicated functions to perform pathway analyses of single-cell RNA-sequencing data.
