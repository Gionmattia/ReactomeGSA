Description: The ReactomeGSA package uses Reactome's online analysis service to perform multi-omics
    gene set analysis. The main advantage of this package is that the retrieved results can be 
    visualized using REACTOME's powerful web application.
    Since Reactome's analysis service also uses R to perform the actual gene set
    analysis, you will get similar results when using the same packages (such as limma and edgeR) locally.
    Therefore, if you only require a gene set analysis, different packages are more suited.
