The quickest way to see the full potential of the 
[ReactomeGSA R package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReactomeGSA.html)
is through our [collection of tutorials](https://github.com/reactome/ReactomeGSA-tutorials). There
we show how to use the [ReactomeGSA R package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReactomeGSA.html)
to perform large-scale comparative pathway analyses of TCGA and CPTAC cancer studies and characterise
single-cell RNA-sequencing data ([go to tutorials site](https://github.com/reactome/ReactomeGSA-tutorials)).
